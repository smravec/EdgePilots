Problems faced over duration of day 2

1. ideation phase prevented from bringing own hardware, left us with what was on site
2. on-site wifi network has been 100% isolating devices, no wired networks was suggested or provided
3. USB cable given as power supply did *not* carry enough power from own power source with enough capacity
4. no means to debug it via serial-over-USB, no advisors suggested it or even tried to mention
5. after another team hinted wrong USB cable, temp cable let it boot, but other problems arose
6. running Edge AI use case, where developed sub-parts were to transfer assumed Raspberry Pi OS *lite* which has bug
7. the bug is about initialization and no chance to detect it, unless boot process is displayed on TV via HDMI
8. out of 3 known teams with Raspie, only 1 succeeded to boot it, and only becuase they had own HW kit from home
9. Raspberry Pi was poor choice of SBC in the first place, provided use cases hint at Edge AI as main theme for 2 from 3 cases

Lessons learned
1. hackathon organizers have limited capacity to choose HW for the event
2. event changes might shake environment, be prepared, have something in the sleeve
3. Raspie is good only *after* it has been booted and made working
